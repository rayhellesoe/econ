                        everybody comment on that in their own time? Working remotely effectively isn't about just
                        replicating the things you'd normally do in an office - if you can't easily get everybody in the
                        same room you may need to adapt.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">But, assuming you do need to meet ...</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Turn on your camera! A video call without video is just a bad phone call.
                        If you have an unreliable internet connection you may need to revert to voice-only, but always
                        start with video on.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 side-panel order-2 order-md-6 w-bg">
                    <h2 class="mt-0">Video Call Basics</h2>
                    <hr class="divider my-4" style="margin: 0" />
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">One person per computer/device (as much as possible) to make it easier
                        for other participants to see who is talking and to pick up non-verbal signals, plus having each
                        person on their own connection puts everybody on equal footing. Or, if that's not an option try
                        to repeat any questions that are asked in the room for the benefit of those who are remote, as
                        they may not be able to hear clearly from those further from the microphone.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Use headphones with a microphone, rather than your laptop's speaker, so
                        you can hear everything that is said first time, and so you can sit further from the screen and
                        still be heard without shouting (out of respect to others sharing your physical space who don't
                        need to hear your call).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Mute when you're not talking to reduce the ambient noise and allow
                        everybody else to hear what is being said - when your microphone is live be mindful of things
                        like drumming your fingers on the table, typing loudly, eating (gross!) or putting down cups etc
                        that can grab focus and be distracting to everybody else trying to listen. Put your phone on
                        silent and turn off notifications (especially ones that ding).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Look at the camera when you are talking rather than at the picture of
                        yourself on your screen - then it will seem like you're making eye contact. If your conferencing
                        tool has 'gallery' view that's a good way to see all of the faces.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Use hand signals to communicate without interrupting when others are
                        speaking - eg a thumbs-up for agree, or a handwave = hello/goodbye. Even simple nods and frowns
                        are useful (most conferencing software will only let one person speak at once, so it's also
                        useful to practise leaving micro-pauses when you finish speaking).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Connect ahead of the scheduled meeting start time to ensure any
                        audio/video/internet gremlins are sorted out before you're holding people up - this is
                        especially important if you're using a new conferencing tool for the first time - it's also a
                        great opportunity for water cooler talk ahead of getting down to business.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Improve your internet connection. There are some easy things you can do
                        that make a big difference - e.g. plug in directly to the router if you can, or if you are
                        connecting via Wi Fi then try to position yourself nearby to your access point - Wi-Fi doesn't
                        always travel well through multiple floors or brick walls etc. When connecting from home, check
                        before the call that there isn't anything else hogging your internet bandwidth such as family
                        members streaming video or computer games etc.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Last but not leastâ€¦</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Be patient. It takes a while to learn these habits, so the meta-etiquette
                        is to always be ready to politely help others who are just working it all out.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Adjust your style to be extra conscious that you're not talking over
                        people</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">- if you are the chair you need to be much more active and even formal to
                        allocate turns to speak, seek input/questions from everybody, and be clear about decisions
                        (especially if the group meeting hasn't yet gotten into the habit of remote calls).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Learn how to put up your hand to speak if there are lots of participants
                        you can use unmuting to signal to the chair of the meeting that you'd like to say something, or
                        keep it simple and just putting your hand up.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Learn how to schedule a new meeting so others can join your call easily
                        (ideally this should be one click for them).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Learn how to share your screen so that you can show presentations,
                        documents or your desktop on the call, when you're presenting pre-prepared information.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Use a chat function to allow people listening to discuss what is being
                        said without interrupting the speaker - if you do this nominate somebody to monitor the chat and
                        raise any points that are relevant.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Install the video calling apps you use on your phone and/or learn how to
                        tether your device so you can connect even when away from an internet connection (most
                        conferencing software is good at downscaling video to lower resolution when you're on a slower
                        connection).</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Think about lighting in the room, so everybody can see you clearly - e.g.
                        best not to sit in front of a bright window etc or you'll just be a silhouette - and dress
                        appropriately for the screen size.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted mb-3">Embrace distractions when people are working at home - sometimes it's fun
                        to stop and talk to people's kids or find out what the courier brought to the door, don't be
                        embarrassed to be human.</p>
