                        <p>“SuiteBox”, “we”, “us”, “our”, and similar means SuiteBox Ltd as the context requires.</p>
                        <p>“You” or “your” means you, the person who has downloaded and is using or uses the Platform
                            and Service and is the licensee under these Terms, or the employer or other entity on whose
                            behalf you are acting.</p>
                        <p>In order to use the Website, Platform, and Services, you are required to accept and to agree
                            to be bound by these Terms. Where applicable you agree to incorporate these Terms into your
                            Products and ensure that your customers adhere to these Terms.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to change, modify, or update the Platform at any time, to impose
                            additional restrictions or limitations on the Service (including, without limitation, the
                            maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the

                            change, modify or update the fees charged for all or a portion of the Service. You agree
                            that SuiteBox has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any
                            data or other content maintained or transmitted by the Service. SuiteBox may decide what
                            features to include in the Service and whether to make them optional or mandatory. You
                            further acknowledge that SuiteBox reserves the right to change these general practices and
                            limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>
                        <p>We also reserve the right to change, modify or update the Terms at any time. If we revise the

                            any changes through such posting. If required by law, SuiteBox will also provide you notice
                            of changes as provided in Section 19. If you do not agree to the revisions, you must cease
                            to use the Platform and remove the Service from Your Product. Your continued use of the

                            that you have accepted the new Terms.</p>

                            “you” and “your” in these Terms mean your company and all of its employees. If you are

                            make separate arrangements with SuiteBox and pay all fees associated with such support (if

                            associated support agreement.</p>
                        <p>k) You hereby grant SuiteBox a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
                            license to display your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and the

                            portion or all of the Services for any reason, including as a result of power outages,
                            system failures or other interruptions; and (ii) we shall also be entitled, without any

                            modifications to any Service; (b) in the event of a denial of service attack or other attack
                            on the Service or other event that we determine, in our sole discretion, may create a risk

                            suspended; or (c) in the event that we determine that any Service is prohibited by
                            applicable law or we otherwise determine that it is necessary or prudent to do so for legal
                            or regulatory reasons (collectively, “Service Suspensions”).</p>

                        <h4>14. TERM</h4>
                        <p>(a) You may terminate the Service at any time, for any or no reason, by deleting your

                            expenses (including attorneys’ fees), that it is any way related to:</p>
                        <p>your use of the Platform or the Service;<br>
                            use of the Service by the users of Your Product;<br>
                            Your Product, including any content, services or advertisements on Your Product or that you
                            incorporate with the Service;<br>

                            arising out of or in connection with any unauthorized use of the Service; and<br>
                            your breach of any representation, warranty or covenant included in these Terms.<br>
                            The foregoing indemnity provision shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other

                        <h4>18. GENERAL INFORMATION</h4>
                        <p>These Terms govern your use of the Platform and the Service and constitute the entire
                            agreement between you and SuiteBox regarding the subject matter hereof. These Terms
                            supersede any prior agreements between you and SuiteBox relating to your use of the Platform
                            and the Service (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of these Terms). The
                            failure of SuiteBox to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not
                            constitute a waiver of that right or provision, and a waiver of any default is not a waiver
                            of any other default. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these
                            Terms to be invalid, the provision shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable
                            law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the parties’ original intentions as reflected in the
                            provision, and so that the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
                            All headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
                            The Terms are personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason
                            whatsoever (including, without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or
                            as a result of an acquisition or change of control involving you) without SuiteBox’s prior
                            written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be void and
                            without effect. SuiteBox expressly reserves and shall have the right to assign the Terms and
                            to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.</p>
