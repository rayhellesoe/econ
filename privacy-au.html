                        <p>In-session information collected during meeting, webinar and training sessions is protected
                            by the use of end-to-end encryption and only accessible by the authorized users, organizers
                            and participants. “In-session information” includes all screen sharing data, keyboard/mouse
                            control data and text chat information. This information is never exposed in unencrypted
                            form while temporarily resident within SuiteBox’s communication infrastructure servers or
                            during transmission across public or private networks. Information about scheduled and prior
                            meetings, webinars and/or trainings is stored on our website and is available to our
                            customers and their authenticated users that have received an invitation from the organizer
                            via email, instant message, phone or other communication method.</p>
                        <p>Occasionally we may also send you promotional information about third parties that we think
                            may be of interest to you.</p>
                        <p>Because of our commitment to present the best possible product to all our users, we track the
                            category of services selected by our individual users as well as all information pertaining
                            to user satisfaction. To ensure the quality of our product, we reserve the right to maintain
                            evaluation and feedback records.</p>
                        <p>BUSINESS INFORMATION: Information that is collected by our products or by meeting, webinar
                            and training organizers or administrators is considered confidential. We will not view
                            Business Information except as necessary to appropriately support the service or as required
                            by law. We protect your business information in accordance with this privacy policy where
                            such information includes personal information. This includes attendee lists, subject names,
                            email addresses, names, session records, and any other information used while in session.
                            When an attendee registers with one of our customers for an online meeting, webinar or
                            training, that information is provided to the organizer of the session. SuiteBox may store
                            that information to fulfil our obligation to our customers, but we will not use this
                            information to send marketing communications for SuiteBox services or third party offers to
                            attendees. You should be aware that any personal information you submit while in session and
                            utilizing the chat feature can be read, collected or used by the meeting organizer and other
                            meeting participants. Chat logs and meeting recordings are not stored or viewable by
                            SuiteBox and are only available locally to meeting organizers and attendees. We will not
                            access or use business information, except as necessary to appropriately support the service
                            and for the purpose of anticipating, diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that
                            might limit or disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as required by
                            law.</p>
                        <p>PARTNERS: In some cases we provide services or sell product lines jointly with other
                            businesses. For these co-branded offerings in which a third party is involved in your
                            transactions, we may share or jointly collect customer’s personal information related to
                            those transactions with that third party. On the co-branded registration pages we will state
                            who is collecting or receiving the information and whose privacy statement governs its use
                            so that you will know who is collecting your personal information and how it’s handled. If
                            you are registered with SuiteBox through a partnership and you request to opt out of
                            receiving promotional updates we will also provide your email address to that partner so
                            that they may also discontinue sending you messages on behalf of SuiteBox.</p>
                        <p>SESSION RECORDS: To maintain our quality of service, to assist in the analysis of product
                            performance, and for billing purposes, we may also gather data on connection information,
