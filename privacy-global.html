                        <h3>Company and Background</h3>
                        <p>SuiteBox Limited, of 8 Mahuhu Cres, Level 4 Britomart, Auckland (“The Company”, “us” or “we”)
                            is a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) company that provides advanced functionality in
                            conjunction with a number of technology partners, including Oracle, Amazon, TokBox, HubSpot
                            and ZenDesk. The “SuiteBox” platform is a friction-less ‘suite’ of tools which enables the
                            modern professional advisor to engage with their clients in a dedicated, virtual, secure and
                            private digital meeting room (‘boxes’). Providing video meetings, audio and video meeting
                            recording, document collaboration, screen sharing, electronic signing and embedded web
                            forms, SuiteBox delivers all the core capability to manage a virtual client business
                            relationship.<br>
                            The data storage and privacy implications vary according to the model that customers can
                            elect, SuiteBox Private Box, Customer owned Private Box or Customer owned on premise
                            Pluggable Storage. They also vary by legal jurisdiction and geographic location. Such
                            privacy implications are described more fully below with the widest scope for SuiteBox,
                            although in practice the implications may be significantly less if customers choose to
                            self-store or use their choice of third-party provider for such records (such as for their
                            CRM records).</p>
                        <h4>Overview</h4>
                        <p>Data privacy and protection legislation is continuously changing at different speeds around
                            the globe. It is commonly considered that the ‘highest standard’ currently in operation is
                            that of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). For brevity, this document
                            describes SuiteBox policy viewed through a GDPR lens. You should check with your Data
                            Privacy and Protection compliance team if your jurisdiction or clients warrant any different
                            considerations – and contact us if you are unsure.<br>
                            The data protection law changed in various European Union (“EU”) countries recently (e.g. in
                            2016 from the Data Protection Act (1998) in the UK (and similar national legislative acts
                            across Europe) to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU (including UK)
                            which became enforceable on the 25thof May 2018.<br>
                            We want to ensure complete transparency for you to understand how your personal information
                            is held and processed and what your rights as an individual are under the new GDPR. We take
                            your privacy very seriously and will only use your personal information for the purposes
                            laid out below. When you provide us your information, we are holding it only for the legal
                            grounds described and will keep it safe and secure.</p>
                        <p>Our legal basis for processing for the personal data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>contractual obligations as stated in clause 4.2, SuiteBox Privacy Procedure (GDPR DOC
                                2.1), which is available upon request using our contact form;</li>
                            <li>to maintain an audit trail and, where applicable, regulatory evidence of professional
                                advice being delivered online via SuiteBox meeting(s);</li>
                            <li>to maintain adequate business records for billing and taxation purposes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We routinely collect and use personal data about individuals, includingpermanent staff,
                            freelancers, contracted staff, or business partners (“you”).&nbsp; We are aware of our
                            responsibilities tohandle your personal data with care, to keep it secure and comply with
                            applicable privacy and data laws/regulation.<br>
                            SuiteBox is designed so that customers can easily elect from three options to store their
                            own customer meeting data (documents, videos):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SuiteBox’s “Private Box” feature allows customers to store their video recordings in a
                                SuiteBox-managed secure archive; or</li>
                            <li>Customer owned “Private Box”, where our customer can provide access to their own Cloud
                                storage options; or</li>
                            <li>Customer owned on premise “Pluggable Storage” option, where meeting artefacts are stored
                                in a client repository so that SuiteBox only stores a reference to the document and
                                basic meta-data. This integration is achieved using SuiteBox’s secure APIs (see API’s
                                section).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This document assumes the SuiteBox “Private Box” scenario for the purposes of completeness.

                            your systems or with your partner’s Data Privacy compliance team where you choose a third
                            party for processing and/storage.</p>
                        <h4>How we use your information</h4>
                        <p>This privacy notice tells you what to expect when we collect personal information.<br>
                            You should be aware that although we will be principally responsible for controlling and
                            looking after your personal data, we may pass your details to other members within the
                            company when required. Your data will comply with the standards set out in this policy and
                            when we pass it on to an external third party for processing, we will not do so without your

                            held securely and they are transparent with any data breaches of your data as well as
                            ensuring that they do not pass your data on to any other 3rdparties without your consent.
                        </p>
                        <p>Rights of the individual</p>
                        <p>As the owner of your data, GDPR is the toolset that allows you to ensure your data protection
                            rights as an individual, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The right to be informed</li>
                            <li>The right of access</li>
                            <li>The right to rectification</li>

                            <li>The right to data portability</li>
                            <li>The right to object</li>
                            <li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This policy shows you how we manage your data to ensure these rights.</p>
                        <h4>What do we collect and why?</h4>
                        <p>When we collect your personal information, we ensure it is managed properly and securely. The
                            core information stored is your name, email address and possibly contact phone number. In
                            addition, SuiteBox or our customers or our customer’s partner may store meeting data such as
                            documents, videos and the like.<br>
                            We typically do not collect information classified as “sensitive”(as name, email address and
                            possibly telephone number are personal but not sensitive information), but if we do work
                            with customers or organisations where this is a requirement then if we collect any
                            additional “sensitive information” as classified by GDPR Article 9 (which relates to
                            physical or mental health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, trade union
                            membership, religious beliefs, sexual preferences, commission or alleged commission of an
                            offence and the sentence of any court, and the processing of genetic or biometric data for
                            the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person), we will ask specifically to collect
                            it and ensure there is extra security around its management and storage.</p>
                        <p>Below are where and how we collect personal data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>As standard, your subscription and related personal data, including billing and payment
                                details if a Subscription Client</li>
                            <li>Video, Audio, Document and Chat records may be collected but are only stored by us with
                                your consent and as a Subscription customer (Corporate customers use their own systems
                                or their preferred partner systems to store such)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will only keep your data in line with our agreed retention policies, unless we have an
                            exception to this, in which case we will ensure you understand the reasons why we will hold
                            for longer.<br>
                            In terms of a subscription we will collect your data as per your agreement and under the
                            terms stated in your contract, allowing us to administer your subscription holding only the
                            minimal required data to do so.<br>
                            During registration, we also ask for your consent about a number of matters related to data
                            handling. We ask for these consents to meet the requirements for the protection of privacy
                            set by various countries: consent for the handling of personal information (including e-mail
                            address and mobile phone number), consent for the handling of sensitive personal
                            information, and consent for the transfer of data to a country other than your home country
                            (SuiteBox uses servers provided by a third party to support its service). These servers may
                            be located either within the EU or outside it. The actual user data and information such as
                            the system’s monitoring data is saved on service providers’ servers currently located
                            outside the EU.</p>
                        <h4>Handling of personal information and its transfer outside the EU</h4>
                        <p>SuiteBox’s services may be delivered using resources and servers located in various countries
                            (such as the U.S.). Therefore, your information may be processed outside the country that
                            the service you are using is based in, including countries outside the European Economic
                            Area (EEA) where the standard of protection of privacy does not meet the requirements set by
                            the European Commission (such as the U.S.). When you register for SuiteBox which requires
                            information transfer to another country for processing, we request your permission for the
                            transfer. When transferring information, we comply with all applicable laws to guarantee
                            sufficient protection of your privacy. In general, when transferring your personal data from
                            one country to another we apply the relevant terms, such as the terms of the EU-U.S. Privacy
                            Shield or those of agreements based on European Commission’s standard contractual clauses.
                            You can find more information on the transfer of information and related security measures
                            on our&nbsp;FAQ section. Confirm FAQ section contains Privacy Shield and 3rdparty privacy
                            policy details too.<br>
                            In line with the principles mentioned above, your information may be transferred or access
                            to it may be permitted to SuiteBox’s subcontractors (such as the supplier of our Customer
                            Care system) that carry out tasks related to SuiteBox’s web site, products and services. Our
                            subcontractors are not authorised to use the personal information for any other purpose and
                            SuiteBox’s subcontractors’ services are always covered by a confidentiality clause.<br>
                            SuiteBox never discloses any of your personal information without a separate permission from
                            you, unless it is necessary for handling your subscription, carrying out your request, or
                            managing our interactive customer programs. Information may, however, be disclosed if
                            necessary because of law, a court order, or a regulation or request issued by
                            authorities.<br>
                            For statistical purposes, SuiteBox may deliver collected anonymized statistical data on its
                            customers, sales, traffic types information, and similar web site information to our
                            third-party technology partners. These statistics do not contain identifiable personal
                            information.</p>

                            This policy will explain areas of the website that may affect your privacy and personal
                            details, how we process, collect, manage and store those details and how your rights under
                            the GDPR, DPA and PECR are adhered to. Our contact information is provided if you have any
                            questions.</p>
                        <h4>Security and performance</h4>
                        <p>We use a number of third-party services, Oracle, Amazon, TokBox, HubSpot and Zendesk, to help
                            maintain the security and performance of our website. To deliver this service it processes
                            the IP addresses of visitors to the website.<br>
                            There are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone
                            or via the internet or other technologies, and no system or technology is completely safe or
                            “tamper”/”hacker” proof. SuiteBox takes appropriate precautions to prevent unauthorised
                            access to and improper use of your personal data. For example, SuiteBox uses encryption and
                            firewall technology when collecting personal data. SuiteBox sites that support online
                            transactions will use industry standard security measures to protect the confidentiality and
                            security of these transactions. We use industry standard security measures, such as SSL
                            authentication, to ensure that your credit card information, as well as other personal data
                            submitted as part of the subscription process, is appropriately safe from third party
                            interception.</p>

                        <h4>Support/Customer Care</h4>
                        <p>SuiteBox’s Customer Care helps you with any problems you may have with our services. Our
                            Customer Care maintains two registers: A “Contact Us” mailbox and Support Requests.
                            Information is saved to both via the SuiteBox.com web site. Customers fill the necessary
                            information in the forms themselves, from where it is transferred to SuiteBox’s systems. The
                            data stored in SuiteBox’s systems may be saved on servers located in the USA or on
                            SuiteBox’s service providers’ servers either within or outside the EU. Read more about the
                            transfer of data and related protective mechanisms here. SuiteBox’s Customer Care operates

                            <strong>The Contact Us mailbox</strong>: the information recorded in the e-mail is
                            transferred to a third-party Customer Care system used by SuiteBox. This system is available
                            to all SuiteBox’s Customer Care personnel. The data recorded in the system is stored on the
                            service provider’s servers located in the USA, New Zealand and the EU. Your contact
                            information (such as an e-mail address and country) is recorded to enable us to respond
                            effectively to your query. Your information is handled confidentially, and the service
                            provider does not have access to the actual data. The information is stored for 6 years
                            unless the local legislation requires longer storage.<br>
                            <strong>Support Request</strong>: the information recorded on this form is used to record

                            to record details of the request and sending automatic e-mail messages about the progress
                            and completion of request, submitting additional requests related to service. Data from the
                            Request is transferred to SuiteBox’s GSS. The information is stored for 6 years unless the
                            local legislation requires longer storage.<br>

                        <h4>Job applicants, current and former employees</h4>
                        <p>When individuals apply to work with us, we will only use the information they supply to us
                            within the company and to process their application. Where we want to disclose information
                            to a third party, for example where we want to obtain a ‘disclosure’ from the UK Disclosure
                            and Barring Service, we will not do so without informing them beforehand unless the
                            disclosure is required by law.<br>
                            Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held, with your explicit
                            permission, for up to 1 year (unless agreed otherwise) after the recruitment exercise has
                            been completed, at which time it will then be destroyed or deleted.<br>
                            Once a person has been hired by us, we will compile a file relating to their service /
                            employment with us. The information contained in this will be kept secure and will only be
                            used for purposes directly relevant to that person’s employment. Once their employment with
                            us has ended, we will retain the file in accordance with the requirements of our retention
                            schedule and then delete it when required to do so.</p>
                        <h4>Complaints regarding your personal data</h4>
                        <p>We try to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information. For this
                            reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously. We encourage people to
                            bring it to our attention if they think that our collection or use of information is unfair,
                            misleading, inappropriate or data has been unfairly shared, lost or held inappropriately. We
                            would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.</p>
                        <h4>How to voice your concerns to us</h4>
                        <p>This privacy notice was drafted with brevity and clarity in mind. It does not provide
                            exhaustive detail of all aspects of our collection and use of personal information. However,
                            we are happy to provide any additional information or explanation needed. Any requests for
                            this should be sent to our Data Protection Administrator at the email address:
                            dpa@suitebox.com<br>
                            If you are unhappy with our response you have the right to escalate this to the Information
                            Commissioner’s Office (ICO) @ https://ico.org.uk/concerns/</p>
                        <h4>Access to personal information</h4>
                        <p>We try to be as open as we can be in terms of giving people access to their personal
                            information. Individuals can find out if we hold any personal information by making a
                            ‘subject access request’, where ourselves and/or any related data controller/processors may
                            charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs to the individual and in a
                            machine-readable format. We will advise you of such fees, if applicable, before continuing
                            further. Once this is confirmed by our receipt of such a written request, if we do hold
                            information about you, we will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>give you a description of it;</li>
                            <li>tell you why we are holding it;</li>
                            <li>tell you who it could be disclosed to, and;</li>
                            <li>let you have a copy of the information in an intelligible form within one calendar
                                month.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To make a request to SuiteBox for any personal information we may hold, you need to put the
                            request in writing, addressing it to our Data Protection Administrator at dpa@suitebox.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>If we do not hold information about you due to it being erased, possibly due to the retention
                            dates being expired or through a previous request for erasure, we will inform you. Any
                            further question can be submitted to our Data Protection Lead and, should you feel the
                            response not be adequate, you have the opportunity to escalate to the ICO.</p>
                        <h4>Right to be forgotten</h4>
                        <p>Within GDPR every individual has the right for their data to be forgotten or erased, unless
                            there are legal grounds which do not allow the erasure, such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>legal obligations, such as the tax legalisation or legal investigation;</li>
                            <li>a contractual obligation that must be fulfilled by the company;</li>
                            <li>public task or interest where it is helping with the detection or prevention of a
                                criminal act.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Should you request to be forgotten or make this request through an authorised third-party,
                            such as your solicitor, we will confirm your/their identity and then proceed to remove your
                            personally identifiable data from our records and send you an audit. We will keep the
                            minimum data to identify you as a living person, in case of an audit by the ICO or where a
                            second request should come in, to prove we have acted in accordance with the GDPR.<br>
                            Again, should you not be happy with the process, you have the right to complain to our Data
                            Protection Lead, and, in turn, if the response is not adequate you retain the right to
                            escalate this to the ICO.</p>
                        <h4>API Integration</h4>
                        <p>SuiteBox’s proprietary Application Programming Interface (API) provides a direct information
                            sharing link between the ecosystem and third-party data systems. With our API’s, our
                            customers may transfer data related to their personal information, which includes: name and
                            e-mail address(es) of meeting participant(s).<br>
                            For third-party developers:<br>
                            To third party systems, SuiteBox offers an API interface and instructions that enable the
                            third party to register its own application in the SuiteBox system and to add users.<br>
                            The developers use their SuiteBox developer “token” to log in to the SuiteBox API services.
                            A new application is registered by providing information on the application and the company.
                            Approval of Terms of Use is required. Personal information collected in connection with
                            registration is collected for billing purposes.<br>
                            When a customer subscribes to using SuiteBox, they enter into an agreement with SuiteBox or
                            its representative. Under this agreement, SuiteBox acts as the data processor while the
                            customer is the data controller. As the data controller, the customer is responsible for
                            what information is saved in the system and how it is handled. The customer is also
                            responsible for the accuracy of the users’ information and data-related requests by
                            individual users and participants (such as requests to delete the information). The customer
                            is also responsible for requesting permission from the user or participant or, in case of a
                            minor, their guardian(s) or carer before adding them to the service.<br>
                            Customers using the API integration are responsible for linking the third-party services
                            they want to use with their SuiteBox account. Information is retrieved by the third-party
                            services and sent by SuiteBox when the user creates a meeting. SuiteBox is not responsible
                            for data once it is transferred out of SuiteBox’s system and it no longer has any influence
                            on the data. Users are responsible for managing the information they share or transfer out
                            of the system.</p>

                        <p>When we receive a complaint from a person we log the details of the complaint and validate
                            them against our records. This normally contains the identity of the complainant and any
                            other individuals involved in the complaint. We will only use the personal information we
                            collect to process the complaint.<br>
                            We usually have to disclose the complainant’s identity to whoever the complaint is about.
                            This is inevitable where, for example, the accuracy of a person’s record is in dispute. If a
                            complainant doesn’t want information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will try to
                            respect that. However, it may not be possible to handle a complaint on an anonymous
                            basis.<br>
                            We will keep personal information contained in complaint files in line with our retention
                            policy. This means that information relating to a complaint will be retained for 6 years
                            from closure. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to it will be
                            restricted according to the “need to know” principle.<br>
                            Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use the information supplied to
                            us to deal with the enquiry and any subsequent issues.</p>
                        <h4>Retention and deletion of data records</h4>
                        <p>We will ensure your data is retained for the agreed retention period and is properly deleted
                            at that point. This also includes any data transmissions that hold data temporarily, as we
                            will ensure they are deleted after the event.</p>
                        <h4>Data Breaches</h4>
                        <p>We ensure all your data is held securely and our staff are trained to understand the many
                            different types of breaches, such as:</p>
                        <p>Hacking by external partiesWe ensure we have the correct security in place to secure our
                            premises and the correct access internally should an internal party look to hack into secure
                            areas<br>
                            Break-ins to our premises and stealing of data or computer equipmentWe abide by a clear desk
                            policy to ensure personal data is secured every evening and security on our premises is
                            checked regularly<br>
                            Virus affecting our IT infrastructureWe have state of the art anti-virus software with
                            backups and disaster recovery in place should we have issues<br>

                            physical security checks and staff awareness ensure we have a safe and secure
                            environment<br>
                            Any data breaches will be detected, reported to the ICO within 72 hours and we will let the
                            individuals know who have been affected while we carry out our investigations.</p>
